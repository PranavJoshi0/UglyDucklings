/*
Iterative-deepening A*. The iterative-deepening technique used for depth-first search (IDDFS) as 
mentioned above can also be used for an A* search. This entirely eliminates the Open and Closed lists. Do
a simple recursive search, keep track of the accumulated path cost g(n), and cut off the search when the 
rating f(n) = g(n) + h(n) exceeds the limit. Begin the first iteration with the cutoff equal to h(start),
and in each succeeding iteration, make the new cutoff the smallest f(n) value which exceeded the old 
cutoff. Similar to IDDFS among brute-force searches, IDA* is asymptotically optimal in space and time 
usage among heuristic searches.
